# 7 Wonders Simulator

A Python-based simulator/engine for the board game 7 Wonders.

## Why This Project?

Despite 7 Wonders being one of the most popular board games (with over 1 million copies sold), there is surprisingly little in terms of digital implementations or simulators available. This project aims to fill that gap by:

1. Providing a complete game engine that accurately simulates all game mechanics
2. Enabling strategy analysis through simulation and statistics
3. Creating a foundation for AI/ML experiments in the 7 Wonders domain

## Current Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress

The project is currently in early development with the following components:

- [ ] Core game mechanics
- [ ] Card effects implementation  
- [ ] Wonder board abilities
- [ ] Game state validation
- [ ] Basic AI players

## Planned Features

- Complete rule enforcement
- Multiple AI player strategies
- Game statistics and analysis tools
- Support for all expansions
- API for external integrations
- Web interface (future)

## Development

This project uses:
- Python 3.12+
- Unit testing
- Type hints
- Clean architecture principles
